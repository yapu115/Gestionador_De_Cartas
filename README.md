# Star Wars Card Manager

## About me

<p>My name is Franco Yapura, and I am a University Programming Technician</p>

<p>I chose to do the project based on Star Wars cards because I love these characters and the task was perfect for solving something related to them.</p>

## App Overview - What it does and how to use it

<p>The app is responsible for keeping track of and managing users' virtual Star Wars card decks. <br>
This task is achieved through a CRUD, which will function differently depending on each user's profile:</p>

- As an administrator, you can add new cards, delete cards you no longer have or no longer need, and modify cards that you have used to level up or down.

- Anyone who i a supervisor will be able to view, add, and modify the cards, but deletion is prohibited.

- Sellers will only be able to view the cards, without adding, modifying or deleting them.

The deck is divided into 4 character types: Jedi, Sith, Mandalorian, and Bounty Hunters, each with their own unique characteristics.<br>

<p>This manager also includes a shared deck of cards. This means that users can have a shared deck, which (depending on their profile) they can control and modify.
This addition is available through a feature in the main menu, where you can choose one of the two aforementioned options.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, users are still able to save their cards and manage them conveniently and securely, even with friends or colleagues.</p>

<p>This manager is quite simple to use. Upon launching the application, the user is prompted to log in and will automatically be taken to the main menu, where they can navigate through the decks for each character type, adding, modifying, or deleting cards, depending on the profile type, using their respective buttons. <br>
Additionally, you can sort cards using the two main card criteria: Life and Power.</p>
  
<p>Finally, with the shared and personal decks feature, you can choose one of these two types and then perform the aforementioned actions.
But be careful, as once you've chosen a deck type and modified any of its elements, you can't change decks.</p>
